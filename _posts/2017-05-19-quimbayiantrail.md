This is a lesser known trail which is located between marsella and pereira, [quimbaya civilization][quimbaya-wikipedia] 
is the name of the first settlers in the coffee region(500 b.c. - 600 a.d), they fought agains the spanian conquerors to 
protect them land, Nona was the name of the cacique and main warrior of the quimbayian tribe, his courage and strength in 
the field became him a legend, this trail is in his honor that's why the name is "sendero natural cacique nona"

the "cacique la nona" trail goes from *Mirador Parque Regional Natural Serrania Alto El Nudo* to
*Reserva forestal la nona-Casa de la carder* ranger's houses 
**google directions aren't very accurate about the trail üôÅ actually the route google suggests is outside the forest reserve,no worries i'll describe the route in deep below**

## Getting there 
The entry point to the trail is the *Reserva forestal la nona-Casa de la carder* ranger's house which is 15-sh minutes by walking
away from a small town called "la convencion", there are two ways you can get there

* by *chiva* from pereira, the *chiva* can be taken in front of the "centro comercial victoria" at 6:00,9:00 and 14:00 and cost $3200 COP 

* Take a bus marsella-pereira in the bus terminal, get off of the bus in la nona 
if you choose this option(this is the route i tracked in the map below) you will have to walk 40 minutes until you get to the "la convension" town
